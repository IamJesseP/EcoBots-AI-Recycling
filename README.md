# EcoBots: Your AI Recycling Companion

A full-stack application utilizing React, Node.js, Express.js, our own hand-crafted AI model, and the Hugging Face API. This application aims to provide users with an interface to identify the value of their individual recycling habits and impact. Users can upload a picture of their recyclable item to have it identified by our AI model as well as given summary findings of the impact they will have to the environment for recycling the item.

The frontend is built with React, while the backend utilizes Node.js and Express.js. The application is hosted on Vercel for the frontend and Heroku for the backend.

## Functionality

### EcoBots Recycling Assistant

  * Image Recognition for Recyclables: Users can upload images of objects, and the AI model identifies whether the objects are recyclable.

  * Informative Dashboard:
     * Recycling Instructions: Once an object is identified, the platform provides guidance on how to properly recycle it.
     * Resource Impact: Displays the resources used to create the object and the potential savings from recycling.
     * Environmental Contribution: Shows the positive environmental impact of recycling the object, emphasizing sustainability.
  * Interactive Chat Interface:
      * Users can engage in a chat-like interface, similar to ChatGPT, where they can ask questions and receive automated responses.
      * The chat interface also displays the results and feedback from the AI after image analysis, as well as navigation for a more detailed summary of their findings.

## What we learned

 **Full-Stack Development** 

  * Learned how to develop a full-stack application, working on both the backend and frontend. 
  The backend was developed using Node.js, while the frontend was developed using React.

**AI Model Development**
  * Applied theoretical understanding of machine learning models to develop practical AI solutions during the Create-a-thon event, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
  * Participated in a diverse team to architect and implement machine learning solutions, employing Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn to solve complex real-world problems.
  *  Navigated complex ML problems by leveraging mentor support, demonstrating problem-solving skills, and efficiently learning new concepts in an independent, remote environment.

  **API Integration**

  * Learned how to integrate the hugging face API to fetch real-time data from our AI model, handle asynchronous operations, and manage responses and errors.


  **Data Formatting**

  * Learned to manage and format data effectively for display on the frontend.

  
 **Server-Client Communication** 

  * Developed an understanding of how the client and server communicate, using various HTTP methods.
  
  
 **Error Handling and Debugging** 
  
  * Throughout the project, faced and resolved numerous errors, which improved our debugging skills and understanding of error handling.
  
  
 **Asynchronous JavaScript** 
  
  * Used asynchronous JavaScript (async/await) to handle asynchronous operations, gaining a deeper understanding of promises and asynchronous execution in JavaScript.
  
 **Deployment and Environment Management** 

  * Learned how to deploy your applications on Heroku and Vercel, and manage different environments for development, testing, and production.
  
  
  
 **Version Control with Git** 
   
  * Learned to manage changes in our project, especially in a group settings with merge conflicts.
